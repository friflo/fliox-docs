# ProtocolRequest.reqId Property

**Declaring Type:** [ProtocolRequest](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub  
**Assembly Version:** 1.0.0

Used only for [RemoteClientHub](../../../Remote/RemoteClientHub/index.md) to enable:

1. Out of order response handling for their corresponding requests.

2. Multiplexing of requests and their responses for multiple clients e.g. [FlioxClient](../../../Client/FlioxClient/index.md)   using the same connection.    This is not a common scenario but it enables using a single [WebSocketClientHub](../../../Remote/WebSocketClientHub/index.md)   used by multiple clients.            The host itself only echos the reqId to [reqId](../../ProtocolResponse/properties/reqId.md) and             does  utilize it internally.

```csharp
[Serialize(Name = "req")]
public int? reqId { get; set; }
```
