# ReadEntitiesResult.ValidateEntities Method

**Declaring Type:** [ReadEntitiesResult](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol.Tasks](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

Validate all value's in the result set. Validation is required for all [EntityContainer](../../../../Host/EntityContainer/index.md) implementations which cannot ensure that the[Json](../../../Models/EntityValue/properties/Json.md) value of [entities](../fields/entities.md) is valid JSON.  E.g. [FileContainer](../../../../Host/FileContainer/index.md) cannot ensure this, as the file content can be written or modified from external processes \- for example by manually changing its JSON content with an editor.  A [MemoryContainer](../../../../Host/MemoryContainer/index.md) does not require validation as its key\/values are always written via Fliox.Hub.Client library \- which generate valid JSON.  So database adapters which can ensure the JSON value is always valid made calling ValidateEntities(ShortString, string, SyncContext)obsolete \- like Postgres\/JSONB, Azure Cosmos DB or MongoDB.

```csharp
public void ValidateEntities(in ShortString container, string keyName, SyncContext syncContext);
```

## Parameters

`container`  ShortString

`keyName`  string

`syncContext`  [SyncContext](../../../../Host/SyncContext/index.md)
