# ProtocolMessage Class

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

ProtocolMessage is the base type for all messages which are classified into request, response and event.

```csharp
[Discriminator("msg", "message type")]
[PolymorphType(Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol.SyncRequest, "sync")]
[PolymorphType(Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol.SyncResponse, "resp")]
[PolymorphType(Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol.ErrorResponse, "error")]
[PolymorphType(Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol.EventMessage, "ev")]
public abstract class ProtocolMessage
```

**Inheritance:** object → ProtocolMessage

**Attributes:** DiscriminatorAttribute,PolymorphTypeAttribute,PolymorphTypeAttribute,PolymorphTypeAttribute,PolymorphTypeAttribute

## Remarks

A ProtocolMessage can also be used in communication going beyond the request \/ response schema. A ProtocolMessage is either one of the following types:

: By applying this classification the protocol can also be used in peer\-to\-peer networking.

General principle of [Friflo.Json.Fliox](../../../index.md) message protocol:All messages like requests (their tasks), responses (their results) and events are stateless.In other words: All messages are self\-contained and doesn't (and must not) rely and previous sent messages. The technical aspect of having a connection e.g. HTTP or WebSocket is not relevant. This enables two fundamental features:1. embedding all messages in various communication protocols like HTTP, WebSockets, TCP, WebRTC or datagram based protocols.2. multiplexing of messages from different clients, servers or peers in a shared connection.This also means all [Friflo.Json.Fliox](../../../index.md) messages doesn't (and must not) require a session.This principle also enables using a single [FlioxHub](../../Host/FlioxHub/index.md) by multiple clients like[FlioxClient](../../Client/FlioxClient/index.md) even for remote clients like [SocketClientHub](../../Remote/SocketClientHub/index.md).
