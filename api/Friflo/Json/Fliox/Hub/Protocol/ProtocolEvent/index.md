| [dstClientId](properties/dstClientId.md) | The target client the event is sent to. This enabled sharing a single (WebSocket) connection by multiple clients. In many scenarios this property is redundant as every client uses a WebSocket exclusively.   |
| [seq](properties/seq.md)                 | Increasing event sequence number starting with 1 for a specific target client [dstClientId](properties/dstClientId.md). Each target client (subscriber) has its own sequence.                                  |
| [srcUserId](properties/srcUserId.md)     | The user which caused the event. Specifically the user which made a database change or sent a message \/ command. The user client is not preserved by en extra property as a use case for this is not obvious. |
