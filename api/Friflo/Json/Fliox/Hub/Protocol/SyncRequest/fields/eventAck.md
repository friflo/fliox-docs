**Declaring Type:** [SyncRequest](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol](../../index.md)

eventAck is used to ensure (change) events are delivered reliable.             A client set eventAck to the last received [seq](../../SyncEvent/fields/seq.md) in case             it has subscribed to database changes by a [SubscribeChanges](../../Tasks/SubscribeChanges/index.md) task.             Otherwise eventAck is null.
