# RemoteClientAccess Enum

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Remote](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

By default a remote client like [SocketClientHub](../SocketClientHub/index.md) can be used by multiple [FlioxClient](../../Client/FlioxClient/index.md)'s.To minimize the size of serialized [EventMessage](../../Protocol/EventMessage/index.md)'s sent to subscribed clients the [EventDispatcher](../../Host/Event/EventDispatcher/index.md)can omit sending the target client id by settings [SendTargetClientId](../../Host/Event/EventDispatcher/properties/SendTargetClientId.md) to false.In this case all [SocketClientHub](../SocketClientHub/index.md)'s must be initialized with Single enabling processing events by the single [FlioxClient](../../Client/FlioxClient/index.md) using a [SocketClientHub](../SocketClientHub/index.md). 

```csharp
public enum RemoteClientAccess
{
    Single = 0,
    Multi = 1
}
```

**Inheritance:** object → ValueType → Enum → RemoteClientAccess
