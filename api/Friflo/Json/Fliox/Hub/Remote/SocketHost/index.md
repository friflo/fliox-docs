# SocketHost Class

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Remote](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

Counterpart of [SocketClientHub](../SocketClientHub/index.md) used by socket implementations running on the server.SocketHost provide a set of methods to:\- parse serialized [SyncRequest](../../Protocol/SyncRequest/index.md) messages.\- execute [SyncRequest](../../Protocol/SyncRequest/index.md)'s and send serialized [SyncResponse](../../Protocol/SyncResponse/index.md) to clientSocketHost is thread safe.

```csharp
public abstract class SocketHost : EventReceiver
```

**Inheritance:** object → [EventReceiver](../../Host/Event/EventReceiver/index.md) → SocketHost

## Remarks

The implementation aims to prevent .Which means it supports  for responses send to clients.If enabling queueing request in [DatabaseService](../../Host/DatabaseService/index.md) can occur in case request execution is not 'instant'Requests can be executed synchronous, asynchronous or on a specific thread \/ execution context.\- If [DatabaseService](../../Host/DatabaseService/index.md) is configured to queue requests they are executed   on the thread calling [queue](../../Host/DatabaseService/fields/queue.md)\- Synchronous in case a request can be executed synchronous\- Asynchronous in case a request requires asynchronous execution
