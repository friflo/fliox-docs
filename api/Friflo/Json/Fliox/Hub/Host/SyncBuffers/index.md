# SyncBuffers Struct

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Host](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

SyncBuffers can be used to minimize heap allocations by passing to [SyncContext](../SyncContext/index.md) constructor.  The the caller of [ExecuteRequestAsync(SyncRequest, SyncContext)](../FlioxHub/methods/ExecuteRequestAsync.md) ensure that only one call to[ExecuteRequestAsync(SyncRequest, SyncContext)](../FlioxHub/methods/ExecuteRequestAsync.md) is running at a time.            This requirement is fulfilled if request execution is stream based like [WebSocketHost](../../Remote/WebSocketHost/index.md)

```csharp
public readonly struct SyncBuffers
```

**Inheritance:** object → ValueType → SyncBuffers

## Constructors
