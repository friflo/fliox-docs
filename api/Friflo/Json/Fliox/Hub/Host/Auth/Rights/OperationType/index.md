# OperationType Enum

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Host.Auth.Rights](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

Use to allow specific container operations in [ContainerAccess](../ContainerAccess/index.md)

```csharp
public enum OperationType
{
    create = 1,
    upsert = 2,
    delete = 3,
    deleteAll = 4,
    merge = 5,
    read = 6,
    query = 7,
    aggregate = 8,
    mutate = 9,
    full = 10
}
```

**Inheritance:** object → ValueType → Enum → OperationType
