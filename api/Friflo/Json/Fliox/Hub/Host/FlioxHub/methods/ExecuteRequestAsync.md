# FlioxHub.ExecuteRequestAsync Method

**Declaring Type:** [FlioxHub](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Host](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

Execute all [tasks](../../../Protocol/SyncRequest/fields/tasks.md) of a [SyncRequest](../../../Protocol/SyncRequest/index.md) send by client.

```csharp
[AsyncStateMachine(Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Host.FlioxHub/<ExecuteRequestAsync>d__0)]
[DebuggerStepThrough]
public Task<ExecuteSyncResult> ExecuteRequestAsync(SyncRequest syncRequest, SyncContext syncContext);
```

## Parameters

`syncRequest`  [SyncRequest](../../../Protocol/SyncRequest/index.md)

`syncContext`  [SyncContext](../../SyncContext/index.md)

## Remarks

All requests to a [FlioxHub](../index.md) are handled by this method. By design this is the 'front door' all requests have to pass to get processed.

ExecuteRequestAsync(SyncRequest, SyncContext) catches exceptions thrown by a [SyncRequestTask](../../../Protocol/Tasks/SyncRequestTask/index.md) but                 this is only a fail safe mechanism.                Thrown exceptions need to be handled by proper error handling in the first place.                 Reasons for the design decision: 

 a) Without a proper error handling the root cause of an error cannot be traced back.

 b) Exceptions are expensive regarding CPU utilization and heap allocation.

An exception can have two different reasons:

 1. The implementation of an [EntityContainer](../../EntityContainer/index.md) is missing a proper error handling.                       A proper error handling requires to set a meaningful [CommandError](../../../Protocol/Models/CommandError/index.md) to[Error](../../../Protocol/Models/ICommandResult/properties/Error.md)

 2. An issue in the namespace [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Protocol](../../../Protocol/index.md) which must to be fixed.

## Returns

Task\<[ExecuteSyncResult](../../ExecuteSyncResult/index.md)\>
