# DatabaseService Constructors

**Declaring Type:** [DatabaseService](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Host](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

If `queue` is set [SyncRequest](../../../Protocol/SyncRequest/index.md) are queued for execution otherwise they are executed as they arrive.

```csharp
public DatabaseService(DatabaseServiceQueue queue = );
```

## Parameters

`queue`  [DatabaseServiceQueue](../../DatabaseServiceQueue/index.md)

## Remarks

To execute queued requests (`queue` is set) [ExecuteQueuedRequestsAsync()](../../DatabaseServiceQueue/methods/ExecuteQueuedRequestsAsync.md#executequeuedrequestsasync)need to be called regularly.This enables requests \/ task execution on the calling thread. This mode guarantee sequential execution of messages, commands and container operations like read, query, create, upsert, merge and delete.So using lock's or other thread synchronization mechanisms are not necessary.
