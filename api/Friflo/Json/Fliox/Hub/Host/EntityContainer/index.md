# EntityContainer Class

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Host](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

An EntityContainer is the abstraction of a collection \/ table used to store entities \/ records  as key value pairs.

```csharp
[CLSCompliant(true)]
public abstract class EntityContainer : IDisposable
```

**Inheritance:** object → EntityContainer

**Attributes:** CLSCompliantAttribute

**Implements:** IDisposable

## Remarks

It uses a string as key and a JSON object as value. Each container is intended to store the entities \/ records of a specific type. E.g. one container for storing JSON objects representing 'articles' another one for storing 'orders'.

EntityContainer define the entire set of interfaces a database adapter needs to implement to               enable the complete feature set of [EntitySet\<T1, T2\>](../../Client/EntitySet-2/index.md) and [FlioxClient](../../Client/FlioxClient/index.md).EntityContainer and all its implementations must be thread safe.

The interface methods are designed to enable clear, compact and efficient implementations of database operations. E.g. operations like SELECT, INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE in case of an SQL database adapter.[MemoryContainer](../MemoryContainer/index.md), [FileContainer](../FileContainer/index.md) and `CosmosContainer` show straight forward implementation of EntityContainer. Additional to memory implementation [FileContainer](../FileContainer/index.md) shows also how to handle database errors. These errors fall into two categories:

1. A complete database request fails. E.g. a SELECT in SQL.                     \=\> [Error](../../Protocol/Models/ICommandResult/properties/Error.md) need to be set.

2. The database request was successful, but one or more entities (key\/values) had an error when accessing.                     E.g. Writing an entity to a file with a [FileContainer](../FileContainer/index.md) fails because it is used by another process.                     \=\> An [EntityError](../../Protocol/Models/EntityError/index.md) need to be added to task result errors.                        E.g. add an error to [errors](../../Protocol/Tasks/CreateEntitiesResult/fields/errors.md) in case of[CreateEntities(CreateEntities, SyncContext)](../FileContainer/methods/CreateEntities.md)All ...Result types returned by the interface methods of EntityContainer like[CreateEntities(CreateEntities, SyncContext)](methods/CreateEntities.md), [ReadEntities(ReadEntities, SyncContext)](methods/ReadEntities.md), ... implement [ICommandResult](../../Protocol/Models/ICommandResult/index.md). In case a database command fails completely  [Error](../../Protocol/Models/ICommandResult/properties/Error.md) needs to be set. See [ExecuteSync(SyncRequest, SyncContext)](../FlioxHub/methods/ExecuteSync.md) for proper error handling.
