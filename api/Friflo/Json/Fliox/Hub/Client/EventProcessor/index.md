# EventProcessor Class

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

An EventProcessor is used to process subscription events subscribed by a [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md)

```csharp
public abstract class EventProcessor
```

**Inheritance:** object → EventProcessor

## Remarks

By default a [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md) uses a [DirectEventProcessor](../DirectEventProcessor/index.md) to handle subscription events in the thread the events arrive.
