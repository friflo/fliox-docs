# HubMessages Class

**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

Used to group message\/command methods by a single class.

```csharp
public class HubMessages
```

**Inheritance:** object → HubMessages

## Remarks

Message\/command methods can be added directly to a [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md) sub class. When adding many methods it can cause confusion between [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md) own methods and the message\/command methods. The intention is to use a sub class of HubMessages as a field in a class extending [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md). This establish differentiation between [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md) own methods and message\/command methods added to a [FlioxClient](../FlioxClient/index.md) sub class.

```
public class TestStore : FlioxClient
{
    // --- commands
    public MyCommands test;
    public TestStore(FlioxHub hub) : base(hub) {
        test = new MyCommands(this);
    }
}
public class MyCommands : HubMessages
{
    public MyCommands(FlioxClient client) : base(client) { }
    public CommandTask <string> Cmd (string param) => SendCommand <string, string>("test.Cmd", param);
}
```
