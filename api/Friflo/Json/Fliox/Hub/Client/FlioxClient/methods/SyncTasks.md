# FlioxClient.SyncTasks Method

**Declaring Type:** [FlioxClient](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub  
**Assembly Version:** 1.0.0

 Execute all tasks created by methods of [EntitySet\<T1, T2\>](../../EntitySet-2/index.md) and [FlioxClient](../index.md)

```csharp
[AsyncStateMachine(Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client.FlioxClient/<SyncTasks>d__29)]
[DebuggerStepThrough]
public Task<SyncResult> SyncTasks();
```

## Remarks

In case any task failed a [SyncTasksException](../../SyncTasksException/index.md) is thrown. As an alternative use [TrySyncTasks()](TrySyncTasks.md) to execute tasks which does not throw an exception. The method can be called without awaiting the result of a previous call. 

## Returns

Task\<[SyncResult](../../SyncResult/index.md)\>
