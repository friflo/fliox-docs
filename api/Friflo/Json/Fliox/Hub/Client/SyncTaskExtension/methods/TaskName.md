# SyncTaskExtension.TaskName Method

**Declaring Type:** [SyncTaskExtension](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

An arbitrary name which can be assigned to a task. Typically the name of the variable the task is assigned to. The `name` is used to simplify finding a [SyncTask](../../SyncTask/index.md) in the source code while debugging. It also simplifies finding a [TaskError](../../TaskError/index.md) by its [Message](../../TaskError/properties/Message.md)or a [TaskResultException](../../TaskResultException/index.md) by its Message. The library itself doesnt use the `name` internally \- its purpose is only to enhance debugging or post\-mortem debugging of application code.

```csharp
public static T TaskName<T>(this T task, string name);
```

## Type Parameters

`T`

## Parameters

`task`  T

`name`  string

## Returns

T
