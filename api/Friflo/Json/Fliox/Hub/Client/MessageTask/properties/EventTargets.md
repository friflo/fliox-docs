# MessageTask.EventTargets Property

**Declaring Type:** [MessageTask](../index.md)  
**Namespace:** [Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client](../../index.md)  
**Assembly:** Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub

Restrict the clients receiving the message as an event in case they setup a subscription with [SubscribeMessage(string, MessageSubscriptionHandler)](../../FlioxClient/methods/SubscribeMessage.md#subscribemessagestring-messagesubscriptionhandler).

```csharp
public EventTargets EventTargets { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

[EventTargets](../../EventTargets/index.md)

## Remarks

A default EventTargets instance is not restricted to specific target users, clients or groups. So a message is forwarded by the Hub as an event to all clients subscribed to the message.
